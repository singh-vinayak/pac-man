# pac-man
Retro Pac Man game using JavaScript :D

I've kept minimalistic styling along with a few touches here and there, and will update the interface soon. üòÅ

Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used:
addEventListener()
getElementById()
querySelector()
for Loop
appendChild()
createElement()
push()
if else statements
classList
switch case
keyCode
forEach()
setTimeout
Class
constructor
setInterval()
removeEventListener

Next steps:
My next goal is to make a copy of this game and apply logic to the ghost moves. At the moment they are choosing a direction to go in at random. I want to apply logic that makes them move closer to wherever Pac-man is.
